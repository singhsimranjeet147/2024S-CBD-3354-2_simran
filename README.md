Python Application on GKE with Cloud SQL
This repository contains a Python application deployed on GKE and connected to a managed PostgreSQL database on GCP. Follow these steps: set up a Cloud SQL instance and create a database and user; update the Python application to use environment variables; create Kubernetes secrets to store credentials; and modify the deployment YAML to pass these secrets as environment variables. Finally, apply the deployment and expose the application to ensure connectivity.
